# Ride Log Server

Hobby project for learning Erlang where the subject domain is logging bike ride info.

# Details

This project is under development.

This is a [rebar3](https://www.rebar3.org/) project. rebar3 commands are used to: build, start, test.

# For Now

A Rider goes on a Ride.

Points along the Ride are recorded.

The Rider can review and save the Ride.

# Future Plans

The RideLog service might one day have a LiveMap with multiple riders.

# References

Drawing a lot of inspiration from [erlang_ls](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls). I'm not quite sure how to structure a project, or to interact with Mnesia (at this time), so I'm leaning on erlang_ls. I really like the project, but it's a little over my head. Maybe this way I can learn the project at the same time and hopefully contribute in the future.
